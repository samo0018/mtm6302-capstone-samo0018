NAME: Anastasia "Nas" Samoyloff STUDENT NUMBER: 41037439 PROJECT: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

I wanted to keep the design of this API website project as simple as possible because it only really serves the purpose of displaying one image. I kept the background of my mockup dark to compliment NASA's website, which was probably intended to look like the darkness of the cosmos. At the top of the page, users can immediately search for a photo of the day by typing in any date they wish. Users can favorite images by clicking the heart outline icon on the top left of the image. Image explanations follow in white on dark text for readability (and to comply with WCAG contrast standards).

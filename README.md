NAME: Anastasia "Nas" Samoyloff STUDENT NUMBER: 41037439 PROJECT: Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

In order to complete this NASA API capstone, I followed the recorded tutorial lecture posted in Brightspace. I also tried to reference prior labs and class notes, but found the tutorial recording to be MUCH more helpful when it came down to walking myself through the process, step by step. The way I learn things, I absolutely must try them in real time so I can see where I am going wrong, and teach myself the process as a new learner. This was an excellent resource, and I am thankful the session was recored and uploaded to Brightspace to use. 

The major challenge for me was keeping the project styled originally to how I wanted it to look. For example, when I tried using my original FONT AWESOME icon buttons for both the original search and favourites button, the javascript did NOT work. I wish I could have gone in to figure out why, because although my capstone API displayed my images and allowed me to favourite the images, I could not keep the style I had originally been inspired to do. So as a new designer, I was disappointed that I could not figure out how to follow through with the vision I had originally.
